# Product/Project Management Notes

First 3 weeks: 6/20/2022 - 7/8/2022

## Reflections on Project Management at PINT
---
### What I think I am able to manage relatively well:
**Translate clients' requirement** into technical plans and task descriptions.
- Objective: Deliver as required, on time.
- **TODO:**
    1)  To ensure that I personally fully understand what the client is looking for.
    2) If not, research into how to technically implement this requirement, in order to
    3) Have a rough idea how much resources (time/how many dev/designs, etc) are needed to develop the requirement.
    4) Give a detailed discription on what is needed, and if possible, scratch out a rough result that the client is seeking.
    5) If needed, write a technical document of How-to.
    6) Make sure that the designers and developers, and cross-functionality teams are on the same page.
    7) Track the progress and make sure shipped on time.

2) Estimate the time endurance of how long a task should be finished, and assign corresponding amount of developers onto it.


### What I need to work on:
1) **Talk in a more Professional/Business way**

How to improve: 
- First, trust myself as a great project manager
- Trust the product that I'm managing
- Treat my clients as fully professional individuals that are trustworthy

2) **Research and Understand the domain** deeper before handling it to developers

For instance, I had little insights into the Facebook authentication token in web. 

How to improve:
- Research into the domain and understand the logic behind first.
- Get 2-3 ways into understanding how 

3) **Long term vision**
- Purpose: Further maintenance of a project.

4) **Measure Performance**
- Purpose: 
## Performance 

Performance is an important part of the user experience and it affects business metrics. It's tempting to think that if you are a good developer you'll end up with a performant site, but the truth is that good performance is rarely a side effect. As with most other thingsâ€”to reach a goal you have to define it clearly. Start the journey by setting a performance budget.

## **Performance Budget**
A performance budget is a set of limits imposed on metrics that affect site performance. This could be the total size of a page, the time it takes to load on a mobile network, or even the number of HTTP requests that are sent. Defining a budget helps get the web performance conversation started. It serves as a point of reference for making decisions about design, technology, and adding features.

Having a budget enables designers to think about the effects of high-resolution images and the number of web fonts they pick. It also helps developers compare different approaches to a problem and evaluate frameworks and libraries based on their size and parsing cost.


- Choose Metrics: 
## Competitive Analysis

Once you've analyzed your own site, it's time to analyze your competitors' sites. Comparing results from websites similar to yours is a great way to figure out a performance budget. Whether you are working on an established project or starting from scratch, this is an important step. You get competitive advantage when you are faster than your competitors.

If you are not sure which sites to look at, here are a few tools to try:

- Google search's "related:" keyword
![Google search's "related" keyword](/imgs/googlerelatedsearch.png)
- Alexa's similar sites feature
- SimilarWeb

## 20% Rule
There's room for improvement and a good guideline for that is the 20% rule. Research states that users recognize a difference in response times when it's greater than 20%. This means that if you want to be noticeably better than the best comparable site, you have to be at least 20% faster.

### Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors that leave your site after only viewing one page. 


## To Clients: (External)
### Section 1: Write Requirements descriptions to dev

## To Internal:













## Random stuff
Smart Contract = a piece of code runs when an action happens.

Webhook

NFT: Cryptographic token that represents a URL
a picture of monkey, make the token, points to that particular URL

point to the URL, not of the monkey
remove the monkey. cannot do that

screenshot of the monkey, and repost that url, could be the same thing.

Financial community, 

CAA, Paris Hilton, manipulation influence concept
famous people associated with the shoes

No legal structures,

political organizations

Proof of work versus proof of stake

blockchain: giant database, cannot update or delete
append only data structure
combine cryptographic thinking with data sructure

use cryptography to make sure each things written to it are unique, cannot redo them

Financial: 
minus particular token concept, people have to do something expensive cryptographic aspect

captcha, bots cannot make accounts. 
generate a lot of tokens

ecologically unfriendly, warehouses of computers that are mining the bitcoins, they use video cards that 
GPU cards are so expensive
drop significantly last few months

bitcoin minings, does use energetic

already more renewable than other 

power consumption per transaction is much more hundreds than VISA.

power be better spent on things that we could do in our world 


powergrids

## Web 2 versus Web 3

Bye NFT on a Web 2 website that is hilarious

It's challenging, see a lot of historical and political things associated with the stuff.

social, technical, political movement!

The web itself 

Within a first 
Saying Web 3 is like Web 2 is totally revisioning the history
utility was already there, people were making money at the first few months when Web 2 was born
