# Product/Project Management Notes
The purpose of the document is tracking my progress in project and product management throughout my internship at PINT, inc.

Current status: Reflections on Project Management at PINT during the first 3 weeks of my internship (6/20/2022 - 7/8/2022)
## 1) What I think I am able to manage relatively well:
### **Translate clients' requirement into task descriptions and technical plans**
- **Objective:** Deliver client's requirement on time.
- **Process:**
    -  First, to ensure that I fully, thoroughly, 100% understand what the client is looking for in this requirement.
        - Understand why the client want this new feature or change. Some motivations include:
            - Need an increase in 
              - Daily Active Users 
              - to attract new users 
              - need an increase in subscription of premium services
              - Other relative metrics.
            - User Experience.
            - One of the competitive products have a similar feature in their latest version.
            - An expansion in their target user group.
            - Market adjustment and innovations
                - A specific demand is diminishing.
                - New emerging demands.
            - Feedback from current users.
            - To follow new state or federal regulations.
    - Briefly research into how to technically implement the feature. 
        - **Tech stacks**
        - Determine how much code repetition/Dupicate codes or modification of similar codes?
        - Do we need to research into new approaches to put into practice? 
    - Have a rough idea on the scope of resources (time/budget/number of devs/designers, etc) needed to successfullys develop the feature.
    - Give a detailed description on what is needed
        - If possible, scratch out a rough result that the client is seeking.
        - Miro is a powerful tool!
    - If needed, write a technical document of How-to.
        - Non-detailed, just to specify the most important details. 
        - Ensure that current technical approach is further maintainable.
    - Make sure that the designers and developers, the cross-functionality teams are on the same page.
        - Efficiently communicate with everyone once there are any updates from clients. 
        - Perfor cross functionality team management (eg. when a feature improvement needs 4 different teams' collab (frontend, backend, QA, UIUX Design).)
    - Track the progress and make sure it got shipped on time.

- **An example:**



## 2) What I need to improve:
### **Talk in a more Professional/Business, and Confident way**
When I'm taking as a project manager rather than a dev, I need to use more professional dictions and wordings to leave a trustworthy impression to my clients. 

- **How to improve:** 
    - First, trust myself as an aspiring project manager
    - Trust the product that I'm managing could be shipped 100% meeting the clients requirement, and even more.
    - Treat my clients as trustworthy individuals, and build a stable, bounded, mutually benefited relationship with them.
    - Practice small talks.
- **PM knowledge and vocabs: (Regularly updated)**
    - Product related: 
        - ship, deliver, milestone
        - Agile: 
            -  Agile is an iterative and adaptive approach to project management
            -  Agile is best for large projects that require more flexibility.
            -  Client feedback is crucial.
        - Scrum：
          - Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.
          - Agile versus Scrum:
          > - Scrum is broken down into shorter sprints and smaller deliverables, while in Agile everything is delivered at the end of the project.
           > - Agile involves members from various cross-functional teams, while a Scrum project team includes specific roles, such as the Scrum Master and Product Owner.
        - Waterfall: 
            - Waterfall is linear in nature and doesn’t allow for revisiting previous steps and phases.
            - Waterfall works well for small projects with clear end goals
            - In Waterfall, clients aren’t typically involved.
  
    - Analytics related: 
        - SEO (Seach Engine Optimization), 
        - Hotjar scroll map 
        - GA4 & UA
        - Urchin Traffic Monitor
        > Dimensions you track via UTM codes show up in your analytics reports to give you a clearer insight into marketing performance. UTM stands for "Urchin Traffic Monitor". This name comes from Urchin Tracker, a web analytics software that served as the base for Google Analytics.
        -  Black Box Weekly Report
        -  Bounce rate
        > The percentage of visitors that leave your site after only viewing one page. 

    - Marketing related: 
        - Daily active users
        - KPI, 
    - PM daily routine: 
        - Daily Standup/Scrum in Agile
        - Retrospective
        - Backlog
### **Research and Understand the domain** deeper before handling it to developers
Usually, I came across something that I don't have a deep insight into. For instance, I know myself lack knowledges in database, computer network, and anything related to system (stuff I would solidfy in my senior year). 
- **How to improve:**
    - Research into the domain and understand the history, logic, and technology behind first.
    - Get familiar with 2-3 common approaches in this domain. 
- **An example:**
For instance, I had little insights into the Facebook authentication token in web. 

### **Set up my Long term vision**
- **Purpose:** 
    - Future maintenance of a project. (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP/SQL, etc are firm and unreplaceble!)
    - Predict market changes in the future
    - Predict user group expansion/recession
    - Predict competitive products launching new features

### **Measure a product's Performance**
- Purpose:  Performance is an important part of the user experience and it affects multiple business metrics.
- As with most other things, to reach a goal I have to define it clearly. Start the project development process by setting a performance budget is essential.

**Note: 20% Rule**

- There's room for improvement and a good guideline for that is the 20% rule. Research states that users recognize a difference in response times when it's greater than 20%. This means that if you want to be noticeably better than the best comparable site, you have to be at least 20% faster.

### **Performance Budget**
A performance budget is a set of limits imposed on metrics that affect site performance. This could be 
 - the total size of a page, 
 - the time it takes to load on a mobile network, 
 - or even the number of HTTP requests that are sent. 
  
  Defining a budget helps get the web performance conversation started. It serves as a point of reference for making decisions about design, technology, and adding features.

Having a budget enables designers to think about the effects of high-resolution images and the number of web fonts they pick. It also helps developers compare different approaches to a problem and evaluate frameworks and libraries based on their size and parsing cost.

> **Note: How to choose Metrics:**
  
### **Competitive Analysis**

Whether we are working on an established project or starting from scratch, we could get competitive advantage when our sites are faster than our competitors.

Here are a few tools to try:

- Google search's "related:" keyword

- SimilarWeb
