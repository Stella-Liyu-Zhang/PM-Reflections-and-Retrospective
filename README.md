# Product/Project Management Notes

### Reflections on Project Management at PINT during the first 3 weeks of my internship (6/20/2022 - 7/8/2022)
## 1) What I think I am able to manage relatively well:
### **Translate clients' requirement into task descriptions and technical plans**
- **Objective:** Deliver to client everything they required, on time.
- **Process:**
    -  To ensure that I personally fully understand what the client is looking for in this requirement.
        - Understand why the client want this change. Some motivations are:
            - Increase in Daily Active Users and other metrics.
            - User Experience elevation.
            - Competitive products probably have similar features updated.
            - Market adjustment and innovations (
                - A specific feature is abandonded
                - New emerging demands
            - Feedback from current users.
            - To follow new rules/laws/state or federal regulations.
    - Briefly research into how to technically implement the feature. 
        - Tech stacks
        - How much repetition/Dupicate codes or modification of similar codes?
        - Do we need to research into new approaches to put into practice? 
    - Have a rough idea on the scope of resources (time/budget/how many dev/designs, etc) needed to successfullys develop the requirement.
    - Give a detailed discription on what is needed
        - If possible, scratch out a rough result that the client is seeking.
        - Miro is a powerful tool!
    - If needed, write a technical document of How-to.
        - Non-detailed, just to keep things on track. 
        - Ensure that current technical approach is further maintainable.
    - Make sure that the designers and developers, the cross-functionality teams are on the same page.
        - Efficiently communicate with everyone once there are any updates from clients. 
        - For instance, when a feature improvement needs 4 different teams' collab (frontend, backend, QA, UIUX Design).
    - Track the progress and make sure it got shipped on time.

- **An example:**



## 2) What I need to improve:
### **Talk in a more Professional/Business, and Confident way**
When I'm taking as a project manager rather than a dev, I need to use more professional dictions and wordings to leave a trustworthy impression to my clients. 

- **How to improve:** 
    - First, trust myself as an aspiring project manager
    - Trust the product that I'm managing could be shipped 100% meeting the clients requirement, and even more.
    - Treat my clients as trustworthy individuals, and build a stable, bounded, mutually benefited relationship with them.
    - Practice small talks.
- **PM knowledge and vocabs: (Regularly updated)**
    - Product related: ship, deliver, milestone,
    - Analytics related: 
        - KPI, 
        - SEO (Seach Engine Optimization), 
        - Hotjar scroll map 
        - GA4 & UA
        - Urchin Traffic Monitor
        > Dimensions you track via UTM codes show up in your analytics reports to give you a clearer insight into marketing performance. UTM stands for "Urchin Traffic Monitor". This name comes from Urchin Tracker, a web analytics software that served as the base for Google Analytics.
        -  Black Box Weekly Report
    - Marketing related: 
        - Daily active users
    - PM daily routine: 
        - Standup
        - Retrospective
        - Backlog
        - Scrum meeting
### **Research and Understand the domain** deeper before handling it to developers
Usually, I came across something that I don't have a deep insight into. For instance, I know myself lack knowledges in database, computer network, and anything related to system (stuff I would solidfy in my senior year). 
- **How to improve:**
    - Research into the domain and understand the history, logic, and technology behind first.
    - Get familiar with 2-3 common approaches in this domain. 
- **An example:**
For instance, I had little insights into the Facebook authentication token in web. 

### **Long term vision**
- **Purpose:** 
    - Future maintenance of a project. (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP/SQL, etc are firm!)
    - Predictable market changes in the future
    - Predictable user group expansion (if there are any)
    - Predictable competitive products launching new features

### **Measure Performance**
- Purpose: 
### **Understand Performance** 

Performance is an important part of the user experience and it affects business metrics. It's tempting to think that if you are a good developer you'll end up with a performant site, but the truth is that good performance is rarely a side effect. As with most other thingsâ€”to reach a goal you have to define it clearly. Start the journey by setting a performance budget.

## **Performance Budget**
A performance budget is a set of limits imposed on metrics that affect site performance. This could be the total size of a page, the time it takes to load on a mobile network, or even the number of HTTP requests that are sent. Defining a budget helps get the web performance conversation started. It serves as a point of reference for making decisions about design, technology, and adding features.

Having a budget enables designers to think about the effects of high-resolution images and the number of web fonts they pick. It also helps developers compare different approaches to a problem and evaluate frameworks and libraries based on their size and parsing cost.


- Choose Metrics: 
## Competitive Analysis

Once you've analyzed your own site, it's time to analyze your competitors' sites. Comparing results from websites similar to yours is a great way to figure out a performance budget. Whether you are working on an established project or starting from scratch, this is an important step. You get competitive advantage when you are faster than your competitors.

If you are not sure which sites to look at, here are a few tools to try:

- Google search's "related:" keyword
![Google search's "related" keyword](/imgs/googlerelatedsearch.png)
- Alexa's similar sites feature
- SimilarWeb

## 20% Rule
There's room for improvement and a good guideline for that is the 20% rule. Research states that users recognize a difference in response times when it's greater than 20%. This means that if you want to be noticeably better than the best comparable site, you have to be at least 20% faster.

### Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors that leave your site after only viewing one page.

NFT: Cryptographic token that represents a URL
a picture of monkey, make the token, points to that particular URL

point to the URL, not of the monkey
remove the monkey. cannot do that

screenshot of the monkey, and repost that url, could be the same thing.

Financial community, 

CAA, Paris Hilton, manipulation influence concept
famous people associated with the shoes

No legal structures,

political organizations

Proof of work versus proof of stake

blockchain: giant database, cannot update or delete
append only data structure
combine cryptographic thinking with data sructure

use cryptography to make sure each things written to it are unique, cannot redo them

Financial: 
minus particular token concept, people have to do something expensive cryptographic aspect

captcha, bots cannot make accounts. 
generate a lot of tokens

GPU cards are so expensive

bitcoin minings, does use energetic

## Web 2 versus Web 3
It's challenging, see a lot of historical and political things associated with the stuff.

social, technical, political movement!
Saying Web 3 is like Web 2 is totally revisioning the history
utility was already there, people were making money at the first few months when Web 2 was born
