# PM Reflections and Retrospective 
The purpose of the document is to track my progress in project and product management throughout my internship at PINT, inc. 

There are some SWE progress tracking as well.

Current status: Reflections on Project Management at PINT during the first 3 weeks of my internship (6/20/2022 - 7/8/2022)
- PM side - Current status in internship:
    - Helping 2 Senior Project managers manage 1 client's products (3 sites, one site has 7 different regional domains to maintain.)
    - Hopefully will step into a redesign project in its dev phrase (Waterfall project currently in design process).
    - Regular retrospectives really helped!
- PM side - What I'm about to learn next in internship:
    - Figure out how to handle the crisis that we already spent 60% percent of the budget within 50% of a year. What if huge dev tasks came next in the rest of the year?
    - Maintain a good, well-rounded, professional relationship with clients and build a stable, long-term network with them.
    - Learn how to write Technical documents in a professional way
- SWE side - Current status in internship:
    - Finished learning HTML
    - Finished learning HTTP
    - In progress of learning image performance and optimization
- SWE side - What I'm about to learn next in internship:
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - API
    - Server
    - Architecture
    - Operating System
    - Networks
    - Sessioning
## 1) What I think I am able to manage relatively well:
### **Translate clients' requirement into task descriptions and technical plans**
- **Objective:** Deliver client's requirement on time.
- **Process:**
    - First, to ensure that I fully, thoroughly, 100% understand what the client is looking for in this requirement.
        - Understand why the client want this new feature or change. Some motivations include:
            - An increase in 
              - Daily Active Users 
              - New registered users 
              - Subscription of premium services
              - Other relative metrics.
            - User Experience.
            - Competitive products have a similar feature updated in their latest version.
            - An expansion/recession in the target user group.
            - Market adjustment and innovations
                - A specific demand is diminishing.
                - New emerging demands.
            - Feedback from current users.
            - To follow new state or federal regulations.
    - Briefly research into how to technically implement the feature. 
        - **Tech stacks**
        - Determine how much code repetition/Dupicate codes or modification of similar codes?
        - Do we need to research into new approaches to put into practice? 
    - Have a rough idea on the scope of resources (time/budget/number of devs/designers, etc) needed to successfullys develop the feature.
    - Give a detailed description on what is needed
        - If possible, scratch out a rough result that the client is seeking.
        - Miro is a powerful tool!
    - If needed, write a technical document of How-to.
        - Non-detailed, just to specify the most important details. 
        - Ensure that current technical approach is further maintainable.
    - Make sure that the designers and developers, the cross-functionality teams are on the same page.
        - Efficiently communicate with everyone once there are any updates from clients. 
        - Perfor cross functionality team management (eg. when a feature improvement needs 4 different teams' collab (frontend, backend, QA, UIUX Design).)
    - Track the progress and make sure it got shipped on time.
    - Ship to client and get client's feedback
    - Review feedback and repeat previous steps.

- **An example:**
    When building the OD articles and resources page, the whole development process lasted for 3 weeks, because there were constant feedback from our client.

    For instance, to remove button, add new button, prioritize the articles. change texts, titles, positions on OD resources.
    Tabbing features are not prioritized. 



### **Prioritize** my tasks.
- **How to prioritize my tasks?**
    - Objective: As a PM and a potential SWE, time management is super important. 

## 2) What I need to improve:
### **Talk in a more Professional/Business, and Confident way**
When I'm taking as a project manager rather than a dev, I need to use more professional dictions and wordings to leave a trustworthy impression to my clients. 

- **How to improve:** 
    - First, trust myself as an aspiring project manager
    - Trust the product that I'm managing could be shipped 100% meeting the clients requirement, and even more.
    - Treat my clients as trustworthy individuals, and build a stable, bounded, mutually benefited relationship with them.
    - Practice small talks.
- **PM knowledge and vocabs: (Regularly updated)**
    - Product Management related: 
        - ship, deliver, milestone
        - Agile: 
            -  Agile is an iterative and adaptive approach to project management
            -  Agile is best for large projects that require more flexibility.
            -  Client feedback is crucial.
        - Scrum：
          - Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.
          - Agile versus Scrum:
          > - Scrum is broken down into shorter sprints and smaller deliverables, while in Agile everything is delivered at the end of the project.
           > - Agile involves members from various cross-functional teams, while a Scrum project team includes specific roles, such as the Scrum Master and Product Owner.
        - Waterfall: 
            - Waterfall is linear in nature and doesn’t allow for revisiting previous steps and phases.
            - Waterfall works well for small projects with clear end goals
            - In Waterfall, clients aren’t typically involved.
  
    - Analytics related: 
        - SEO (Seach Engine Optimization), 
        - Hotjar scroll map 
        - GA4 & UA
        - Urchin Traffic Monitor
        > Dimensions you track via UTM codes show up in your analytics reports to give you a clearer insight into marketing performance. UTM stands for "Urchin Traffic Monitor". This name comes from Urchin Tracker, a web analytics software that served as the base for Google Analytics.
        -  Black Box Weekly Report
        -  Bounce rate
        > The percentage of visitors that leave your site after only viewing one page. 

    - Marketing related: 
        - Daily active users
        - KPI
    - PM daily routine: 
        - Daily Standup/Scrum in Agile
        - Retrospective
        - Backlog
### **Research and Understand the domain** deeper before handling it to developers
Usually, I came across something that I don't have a deep insight into. For instance, I know myself lack knowledges in database, computer network, and anything related to system (stuff I would solidfy in my senior year). 
- **How to improve:**
    - Research into the domain and understand the history, logic, and technology behind first.
    - Get familiar with 2-3 common approaches in this domain. 
- **An example:**
For instance, I had little insights into the Facebook authentication token in web. 

### **Set up my Long term vision**
- **Purpose:** 
    - Future maintenance of a project. (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP/SQL, etc are firm and unreplaceble!)
    - Predict market changes in the future
    - Predict user group expansion/recession
    - Predict competitive products launching new features
### **Budget Management**
   - Throught my internship I raised a question: 
   1) What if in the middle of a project we have already spent 60% of the budget? How do we make sure that we ship the product to client without adding extra money?
- **What I could  in this case:**
    - Let the client know 
        - There are holidays in the second half of the year (maybe?)
    - Let the Dev team know
        - They shall probably be more proficient with their work??
        - But do not pressure them, make sure the quality of delivery is promised.
        - If there are any case, we may want to give up less prioritized features??
- **Goal**

    - Find a balance between overloading the dev team, and deliver as much as possible to make sure our clients are satisfied.
    - In a nutshell, make sure our dev team and clients are both happy (PM is that one person in the middle ooof)
### **Handle an emergency/PR Crisis**
How to manage an emergency could be divided into 2 parts:
- How to talk to clients (Handle a PR Crisis)


- How to efficiently solve the problem on time

### **Measure a product's Performance**
- Purpose:  Performance is an important part of the user experience and it affects multiple business metrics.
- As with most other things, to reach a goal I have to define it clearly. Start the project development process by setting a performance budget is essential.

**Note: 20% Rule**

- There's room for improvement and a good guideline for that is the 20% rule. Research states that users recognize a difference in response times when it's greater than 20%. This means that if you want to be noticeably better than the best comparable site, you have to be at least 20% faster.

### **Performance Budget**
A performance budget is a set of limits imposed on metrics that affect site performance. This could be 
 - the total size of a page, 
 - the time it takes to load on a mobile network, 
 - or even the number of HTTP requests that are sent. 
  
  Defining a budget helps get the web performance conversation started. It serves as a point of reference for making decisions about design, technology, and adding features.

Having a budget enables designers to think about the effects of high-resolution images and the number of web fonts they pick. It also helps developers compare different approaches to a problem and evaluate frameworks and libraries based on their size and parsing cost.

> **Note: How to choose Metrics:**
  
### **Competitive Analysis**

Whether we are working on an established project or starting from scratch, we could get competitive advantage when our sites are faster than our competitors.

Here are a few tools to try:

- Google search's "related:" keyword
